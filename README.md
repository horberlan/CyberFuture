Times change and apps needs to adapt to those changes❗

With this library you can change the visual of your components to give your app a more "cybish" aspect. 

🚧 This library is still under development, but you can try some components and collaborate at will. 🚧


### Components:
You can install our library and import the button component:
```javascript
import {Button, Card} from 'cyberfuture'
```
and use it with the some of the props we deployed. For instance:
```html
<Button text='Button' variant='Matrix' color='Gold' />
<Button text='Button' variant='AutlinedCyberRose' color='matrix' />
<Card variant='matrix' title="Card Title" End={<Button text='BUTTON' variant='Matrix' />}/>
```

### Variants: 
These are the variants we have built up to now:
* matrix;
* gold;
* cyber;
* rose;
* punk;

### Types:
And these are the types we have deployed by now:
* outlined;
* contained;

👩‍💻 We are building a webpage for showing our components.
<br/>
But, we are very busy. Please, be patient...
